Dynamic Asset Helper

This plugin allows for dynamic inclusion of javascript and css assets based on basic routes.

For example, the path {:controller => 'products', :action => 'list'} might have custom
JS or CSS files specifically for use by that view. This plugin aims to make that easier.

By placing <%= dynamic_stylesheet_link_tag %> and/or <%= dynamic_javascript_include_tag %>
in your view, this plugin will look for files at the following paths
(given the example path above)
'/stylesheets/products.css', '/stylesheets/products/list.css'
'/javascripts/products.js', '/javascripts/products/list.js'
A <script> and/or <link> tag will be generated for each file that exists.

This can be especially helpful since no tags will be output if no css or js file exists
to be included. Think of it as a way to override or add on to the global look and feel of your
site, for a specific path.

I realize this plugin may not have performance in mind, since it's doing File.exists? checks
upon every page load. So please keep in mind this is intended for a small audience who needs it
and should probably only be used to speed up development.

Although, I hear word that rails 2.0 may include functionality to automagically combine a cached
version of all assets of the same time from a path tree like this plugin is doing.
I guess time will tell...
